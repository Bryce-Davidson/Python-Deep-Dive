# Objective

The objective of this repository is to learn as much as possbile about the underlying nature of the Python proggramming language.

The [documentation][1] of Python contains a vaste amount of resources for comprehending the structure and layout of the language and I intend to form this repository as a guide to the important concepts.

I will explore both the [language reference][2] as well as the [standard library reference][3] starting with the language reference for **Python 3.8.8** found [here][4].

This repository is not inteded as a *complete* guide and I will explore more of the quirks of the language first and foremost.
